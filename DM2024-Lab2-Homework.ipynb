    "Based on the comparison, it can be observed that Naive Bayes is relatively weaker in distinguishing angry emotions. Additionally, there is some similarity between fear and sadness or anger, leading to occasional misclassifications. More prominent errors (i.e., a higher number of misclassifications) are present across all emotional categories except for joy. Overall, Naive Bayes is generally recognized to produce better results because it excels at handling high-dimensional textual data. However, its performance in distinguishing anger and sadness is weaker, possibly due to the assumption of feature independence in Naive Bayes. Emotions like anger and sadness require the interdependence of features for more accurate classification. On the other hand, fear-related emotions tend to achieve better results under the assumption of feature independence."

    "Observing the Model Accuracy and Model Loss plots can help identify when the model starts to overfit. From the Accuracy plot, it can be seen that before epoch 5, the growth trend of the validation accuracy begins to plateau. At this point, only the training accuracy continues to increase, while the validation accuracy remains stable. This indicates that the model starts to overfit around epoch 5. Similarly, in the Model Loss plot, the validation loss starts to increase sharply at epoch 5, whereas the training loss continues to decrease. This is another clear sign of overfitting."

    "Observing the two plots, it can be seen that the UMAP results are more compact, while the t-SNE results are more dispersed. If all points are displayed in the same color, UMAP's results make it easier to distinguish which points form a group compared to t-SNE. This indirectly suggests that t-SNE may overlook global relationships."

Among them, XGBoost performed very poorly, producing outputs limited to only three emotion categories, resulting in poor outcomes. Initially, I determined that this was not a data issue, as the input was consistent across all models. Therefore, I decided not to use XGBoost as my model. As for Decision Tree and Random Forest, while Decision Tree trained faster, Random Forest produced better results. Ultimately, I chose to fine-tune Random Forest to find the best-performing model."
